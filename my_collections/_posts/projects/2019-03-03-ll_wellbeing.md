The project aims at understanding the relationship between environmental as well as human contexts and health, well-being and productivity of
individuals working in Link Lab.  

As people go about their daily lives, their everyday experience captured using actively and passively collected data from smartphones, smartwatches or
other smart devices could prove promising for assessing their health, well-being and productivity. People spend a major portion of their day at work
and it is estimated that the life expectancy of people in a stressful environment reduces. Also, environmental stress can cause a decline in
productivity and have negative effects on health and well-being. Thus, in this project we will try to understand how everyday human experience as
captured by smart devices relates with the well-being of Link Lab residents in the context of different environmental conditions.
