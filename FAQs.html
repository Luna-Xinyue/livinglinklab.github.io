			<ul class= "answer">
				<li class="question"> <h4> I am a participant </h4></li>
					<ul class="answer">
						<li>All studies that relate to this platform has to go through the Institutional Review Board (IRB). See here for the consent form. </li>
						<li>In addition, participants are provided with an option to choose what information they are providing. The Living Link Lab sensors can be divided into three categories of Environmental Sensing, Human Sensing, and Operational monitoring.</li>
						<ul>
							<li class="question">Environmental Sensing</li>
							<ul class="answer">
								<li>Include temperature, humidity, air quality and lighting in different locations in the lab. The Living Link Lab interactive map provides an overview of the location and distribution of these sensors in the lab. </li>
								<li> See the sensor page <a href="/sensors"> here </a> for a full list of the environmental sensors and specifications. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="question"> Human Sensing </li>
							<ul class="answer">
								<li>Includes wearable devices and video cameras. </li>
								<li> Videos are collected through a webcam setup in front of the participant. There are a number of automated approaches are applied to increase the privacy of participants and other Link Lab members. These include background subtraction (to remove people or dynamic changes within the environment), participant recognition (remove any scene that includes other people than consented participants). </li>
								<li> See the sensor page <a href="/sensors"> here </a> for a full list of the human sensors and specifications. </li>
							</ul>
							<li class="question">Operational Monitoring</li>
							<ul class="answer">
								<li> Operational monitoring includes energy monitoring, water consumption, and waste and recycling generation. </li>
								<li> Energy consumption monitoring is conducted at the appliance level and circuit level. To get more details about these sensors, click <a href="/sensors">here</a>. </li>
								<li>Six water pipes consumption rates are monitored </li>

			<h3 class="question"> Where is the data being stored? </h3>
			<ul class="answer">
				<p>
					<li> <b>Environmental, energy and water consumption data</b> are being stored in a database hosted at Rice Hall.</li>
					<li> <b>Participant videos</b> are initially stored on <a href="https://virginia.service-now.com/its?id=kb_article&sys_id=13f08053db7ac744f032f1f51d9619da" target="_blank">UVABox</a> and upon participant approval, they are moved to a local hard drive. </li>
					<li> <b>Heart-rate and wearable data</b> are initially stored on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank">AWS S3 Bucket</a> and then later transferred similarly.</li>
					<li> For more detail on system architecture and data storages can be found here. </li>
